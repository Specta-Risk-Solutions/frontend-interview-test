# FXIQ Junior Frontend Developer Test

The purpose of this test (and its nature) is to observe your perspective on how frontend applications should be structured.
<br /><br />

## Setting up.

To setup this project, do the following:

1. Clone the project.
2. Install all dependencies.
3. Run the app.
4. Setup an account on the [NYTimes public API](https://developer.nytimes.com/).
5. Get your API key and replace it with \<your-api-key> on all the API calls on the web app.
   <br /><br />

## What is expected of you?

1. **Structure the web app properly.** As you can see, this web app is poorly structured (if structured at all) and your assignment in this regard is to break the application into logically dividable parts in a way that it's optimized to follow S.O.L.I.D. principles. However you think "Structure" in a frontend application should look like, we'd like to see you represent that in your work.

2. **Add a feature.** If you go to the `/library` page, you can see that there is a button "Add new book" that reveals a form when it's clicked. The content of that form is currently being saved to state; your task is to save the data to local storage and remove all default data.

3. **Bug fixing.** There are a couple styling and integration bugs scattered around the app. Find and fix. 

4. **Improve styling**. This attracts flexible points. We're judging the responsiveness, transitions and color choices (optional).

4. **Creativity.** This is not a compulsory TODO, but would attract bonus points. We want you to add a feature of your own. Anything you want.  
   <br /><br />

## How to submit.

1. Create a feature branch.
2. Work on each task and submit them individually in commits.
3. When you're done, create a PR and send an email with the link to that PR to the email that sent you the repo link.
